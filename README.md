The goal of the Data Science experiment is to develop a classification algorithm that, based on the collected customer data, will be able to decide whether a person will withdraw the money he has from his bank account or remain a customer. The classifications made will be based on the following categories:
Leaving (marked as 1)
Staying (marked as 0)
